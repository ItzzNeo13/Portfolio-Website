    <h1>REVIEW</h1>
    <div id="review-window">
      <p>I made this page as an attempt to share my thoughts and opinions on a book, film or series with others, and to help others
        make
        an informed decision about whether or not they want to read/watch the book/movie. I will update this page when I make
        a major change in website or
        I have a really good recommendation.</p>

      <h3>Type: Book</h3>
      <h3>Genre: Psychology, Memoir & Self-help.</h3>
      <h3>Creator (Author): Viktor E. Frankl</h3>
      <p>Since I have a deep interest in History and especially in the events that happened during the World War Eras, I was considering this book for a while.
        Man's Search For Meaning is based on Frankl's experiences as a prisoner in Nazi concentration camps during
        World War II. During his time in the camps, Frankl observed that those who survived were often those who found meaning
        and purpose in their lives, even in the midst of extreme suffering and pain. He developed his own form of psychotherapy called
        logotherapy, which focuses on finding meaning in life as a way to overcome hardships in life.<br>
        When I was reading the book, I was amazed by the hope Dr. Frankl had when facing challenges at the infamous Auschwitz
        concentration camp. This is book is really a good source of inspiration for the people who are currently in the phrase where they are
        face-to-face with multiple problems in their life.
      </p>
      <p><b>Key Takeaways from the book are:</b>
        <li>
          The attempt to develop some kind of humor and to see things in a humorous light is a trick learned when mastering the
          art of living.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are always choices to be made.
        </li>
        <li>
          Without suffering and death, human life cannot be complete
        </li>
        <li>
          He who has the <em>why</em> to live for can bear with almost any <em>how.</em>
        </li>
      </p>
      <p><b>Conclusion:</b> I found the book to be really helpful in providing a good advice not only for the people who want to have a
      strong mindset as they are facing challenges in their life but also in giving good general advice and developing a
      deeper understanding of the human nature. If you have an interest in learning about history and psychology this is a great book. Would recommend it!</p>
