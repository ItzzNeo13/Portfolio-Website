Last Update Changes - 
- Minimized website by removing Portfolio and Project Pages (Added portfolio link in About and Coding is something I am actively doing)
- Removed sitemap and robots.txt

The website may remain like this for a while if I don't find a need to add more content unless it is absolutely necessary.
